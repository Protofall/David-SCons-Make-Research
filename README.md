# SCons-Make-Research
Software used to get data from SCons and Make projects

For my research project I need to compare a set of projects using SCons against a set of projects using Make. This repository contains text files with links to my test data repositories, a bash script to clone and search the repositories for relevant data and an output csv file with the extracted data.
